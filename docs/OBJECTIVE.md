My acquisition criteria:

**Two-Tier Strategy**
1. **Income Replacement** — $200k+ SDE, up to $300k down, SBA financing OK
2. **Side-of-Desk** — smaller software/SaaS, <$100k, min $1k MRR

**Target Profile**
- Cash flow: $300k–$1.5M (major acquisitions)
- Geography: within driving distance of Madison for larger deals; nationwide for smaller SaaS
- Valuation expectation: 2–4x annual profit
- Prefer: tech, software, PCB manufacturing, upstream value creation

**Hard Avoids**
- Content generation (blogs, YouTube)
- Ecommerce
- Mobile apps
- Food/lawncare/daycare/construction/B2C

**Scoring Framework (9 dimensions)**
- Payback period
- Revenue quality
- Market tailwinds
- Customer count (hard gate)
- Profitability (hard gate)
- Plus four others you've weighted

**Due Diligence Requirements**
- Revenue verification via direct platform access (not screenshots)
- CapEx evaluated relative to profitability, not absolute $
- For franchises: FDD analysis, failure rates, territory availability patterns, reimbursement mix

**Operational Fit**
- Smaller acquisitions must scale without full-time involvement
- Operational load flexible during transition
- Both tiers equally valuable (not hierarchical)
