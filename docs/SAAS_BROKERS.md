# Acquiring Small SaaS: A Sub-$100k Buyer's Playbook

**Acquire.com dominates this price bracket for good reason—it's the only major platform purpose-built for SaaS with verified MRR and reasonable 8% fees.** Flippa offers volume but requires significant buyer diligence below $50k where listings go unverified. The traditional brokers (Empire Flippers, FE International, Quiet Light) won't touch deals this small—their minimums start at $100k-$250k. Your best opportunities may actually come from lesser-known platforms like Microns.io and the indie hacker community, where competition is lower and sellers are more founder-friendly.

At this deal size, you're essentially buying a job you can automate—expect to pay **2-4x annual profit** for a business requiring 5-10 hours weekly. The key is finding a self-serve product with low support burden and stable, diversified customers.

## The major marketplace landscape heavily favors Acquire.com

For sub-$100k SaaS with verified MRR, Acquire.com stands alone among mainstream platforms. It's the only major marketplace built specifically for software businesses, with direct Stripe/payment processor integrations that verify revenue claims—not just screenshots.

**Acquire.com** charges sellers an **8% success fee** for deals under $250k, plus a $25/month listing fee. Buyers can browse free but need a **$390/year Premium subscription** (or $780 Platinum) for full access and direct messaging. Free escrow through Escrow.com is included—a significant cost savings. The platform claims 500k+ registered buyers and has facilitated over $2 billion in verified buyer funds. Its sweet spot is $50k-$500k, making it ideal for this price range.

**Flippa** provides massive volume but operates on a "buyer beware" model for smaller deals. Critical point: **listings under $50k are NOT verified**—anyone can claim any revenue figure. Sellers pay $29-$699 in listing fees plus a **10% success fee** on sales under $50k. The platform is dominated by content sites and e-commerce; genuine SaaS represents a minority of listings. That said, Flippa's sheer scale means deals exist if you're willing to do extensive due diligence yourself.

| Platform | SaaS Focus | Sub-$100k? | Seller Fee | Listing Fee | Revenue Verified? |
|----------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Acquire.com** | Core focus | Yes | 8% | $25/mo | Yes (Stripe integration) |
| **Flippa** | Minority of listings | Yes | 10% (<$50k) | $29-$699 | No under $50k |
| **Empire Flippers** | Growing | Rarely | 15% | $0 | Yes, but $2k/mo profit minimum |
| **FE International** | Expert | No | 10-15% | $0 | Yes, but $500k+ deals only |
| **Quiet Light** | Available | No | 10% | $0 | Yes, but $250k minimum |
| **Motion Invest** | **None** | N/A | 5-20% | $0 | N/A—content sites only |

A common misconception: **Motion Invest does not handle SaaS businesses at all.** It exclusively lists content websites (blogs, affiliate sites) and recently added YouTube channels. If you see it recommended for SaaS acquisition, that's outdated or incorrect information.

## The niche platforms most buyers overlook

The indie hacker ecosystem has spawned several SaaS-specific marketplaces that often offer better value than mainstream platforms—particularly **Microns.io**, which may be the best-kept secret in micro-SaaS acquisition.

**Microns.io** specializes exclusively in micro-startups priced $200-$500k, with most deals under $100k. The key differentiator: **sellers pay zero fees**—no commission, no listing costs. Buyers pay $299/year for premium access with early deal notifications and detailed metrics. The platform manually vets all listings and has closed roughly 40 deals worth $185k in 2023 alone. Founder Ilya Novohatskyi is reportedly highly responsive. For first-time buyers, this is arguably the best starting point.

**Little Exits** (rebranded from Tiny Acquisitions in April 2024) focuses on indie hacker projects under $100k. It charges $249/year for premium access plus a **9.5% transaction fee** if using their escrow. With 750+ listings and 25,000+ members, activity is solid, though some users report stale listings. The platform has partnered with DueDilio for optional due diligence support.

**SideProjectors** operates as a free-for-all "Craigslist for side projects"—no listing fees, no transaction fees, no vetting. Quality varies wildly, but it's useful for discovering very early-stage opportunities at rock-bottom prices. Expect to do all due diligence yourself.

Beyond formal marketplaces, significant deal flow happens through community channels:

- **IndieHackers.com**: Not a formal marketplace, but founders regularly post "considering selling" threads. Build reputation by participating, then watch for opportunities.
- **Twitter/X #buildinpublic community**: Follow @acquiredotcom, @micronsio, and Rob Walling (@robwalling). Founders often announce interest in selling via DMs.
- **MicroConf Connect**: Paid Slack community of ~2-5k bootstrapped SaaS founders. Not deal-focused, but members share opportunities.
- **The Website Flip newsletter**: $197/month premium tier offers 24-hour early access to off-market deals through a 13k+ member Facebook group.

## Why brokers won't return your calls (and when to use them anyway)

Traditional M&A brokers largely ignore sub-$100k deals—the math doesn't work for them. A 10-15% commission on a $50k sale yields $5-7.5k, barely covering the effort of due diligence, buyer vetting, and deal coordination. Empire Flippers requires **minimum $2k monthly net profit** for 12 months. Quiet Light targets $250k+ listings. FE International focuses on $500k and up.

**The broker value proposition breaks down at this deal size.** Full-service brokers typically provide pre-vetting, financial verification, buyer screening, negotiation support, documentation, and migration assistance. At sub-$100k, you can replicate most of this yourself for a fraction of the cost:

| Service | Broker Cost (on $75k deal) | DIY Cost |
|---------|---------------------------|----------|
| Transaction fee | $7,500-$11,250 (10-15%) | $0 |
| Technical due diligence | Included | $500-$1,500 |
| Financial review | Included | $500-$1,000 |
| Legal review | Included | $500-$2,000 |
| Escrow | Included | Free on Acquire.com |
| **Total** | **$7,500-$11,250** | **$1,500-$4,500** |

**The recommendation is clear**: use self-service marketplaces (Acquire.com, Microns.io, Flippa) and hire specialists as needed. Pay a developer $500-$1,500 for a 10-hour code review. Have a lawyer review the Asset Purchase Agreement for $500-$1,000. Use the platform's free escrow. Total investment: roughly **$1,500-$4,500** versus a five-figure broker fee.

One exception: if you're acquiring multiple businesses or have zero experience, Empire Flippers' "Flippa Broker" service offers light brokerage support on larger Flippa listings for $999 plus a reduced success fee—potentially worth it for deals approaching $100k.

## The due diligence that actually matters at this scale

Revenue verification is the single most important step—and the most commonly faked element of small SaaS listings. **Never trust screenshots.** Request read-only access to Stripe, Paddle, or Chargebee dashboards directly. Acquire.com's platform integration can verify this automatically; on other platforms, demand direct access before getting serious.

**Critical financial metrics to verify independently:**
- **12-24 months MRR history**: You need the trend, not just current numbers. A sudden spike before listing suggests manipulation.
- **Monthly churn rate**: Under 6% is healthy; over 10% is a red flag requiring explanation.
- **Customer concentration**: If top 3 customers represent >40% of revenue, one departure could tank the business.
- **Bank statement reconciliation**: Revenue claimed should match deposits. This catches lifetime deal inflation and deferred revenue issues.

**Revenue manipulation tactics to watch for:**
- Flash sale spikes before listing (one-time revenue counted as recurring)
- Lifetime deals stacked to inflate "MRR" (those customers won't pay again)
- Annual prepayments recognized upfront but not yet earned
- Fake test accounts inflating user counts

**Technical due diligence** deserves roughly $500-$1,500 investment in a developer review. Have them assess: code quality and documentation, test coverage, deployment complexity, security vulnerabilities, outdated dependencies, and third-party service dependencies. A product built by multiple contractors with no documentation is a red flag—you're inheriting technical debt you'll need to either pay down or live with.

The transfer itself involves more moving parts than many first-time buyers expect: domain names, source code and repositories, hosting accounts, payment processor accounts (often require new setup), customer lists, social media accounts, and trademark/IP assignments. Some third-party API accounts cannot be transferred and require re-registration. Build a comprehensive asset transfer checklist before closing.

## What makes a genuinely side-project-friendly acquisition

Not all SaaS businesses under $100k can realistically be operated in 5-10 hours weekly. The difference between a sustainable side project and a second job comes down to specific operational characteristics.

**Ideal traits for part-time operation:**
- Self-serve onboarding (no demos or sales calls)
- Automated billing and subscription management
- Fewer than 5 support tickets per week
- Simple tech stack you can maintain personally
- No enterprise customers requiring handholding
- Documentation-based support reducing repeat questions

**Avoid these high-touch characteristics:**
- Sales-assisted demos or onboarding calls
- Custom implementations or white-labeling
- Enterprise contracts with dedicated account management
- Complex integrations requiring ongoing development
- Real-time systems where downtime causes immediate customer impact
- Heavy compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2 without existing infrastructure)

Ask sellers for their weekly hours breakdown and verify against support ticket volume. A business claiming "2 hours/week" with 30+ support tickets weekly is misrepresenting workload. Request access to Intercom, Zendesk, or help desk data if available.

For pricing, current market data suggests **2-4x seller's discretionary earnings (SDE)** for sub-$100k ARR businesses. A $1k MRR business ($12k ARR) generating $8k annual profit might reasonably sell for $20-32k. Pure revenue multiples only apply to larger, faster-growing businesses—at this scale, buyers pay for profit, not potential. As Flippa broker Nick Carlucci notes: "Below ARR of $1M, the business is owner-operated. Buyers pay a multiple on profit generated, typically 2-4x."

## Red flags that should kill a deal

Certain warning signs warrant immediate walk-away, regardless of how attractive the listing appears:

**Financial red flags:**
- Numbers don't reconcile (Stripe ≠ bank statements ≠ claimed revenue)
- Sudden revenue spikes in months before listing
- Seller cannot clearly explain all revenue streams
- Heavy lifetime deal revenue counting toward MRR claims

**Seller behavior red flags:**
- Evasive or inconsistent answers about financials
- Refuses reasonable documentation requests
- Rushing to close with artificial urgency
- "Perfect" metrics across every dimension (too good to be true)
- No clear reason for selling a profitable, growing business

**Operational red flags:**
- Code from multiple contractors with no documentation
- Single marketing channel dependency (all traffic from one source)
- Founder spending 40+ hours weekly (this is a job, not a side project)
- Customer complaints visible in app store reviews or social media

Serial acquirer Sujan Patel (9+ SaaS acquisitions) offers this guidance: "If there's anything wrong with the code or the marketing, walk away. It's much easier to find the right company with potential than to fix a big problem."

## Structuring the deal and managing transition

**Almost always use an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA)**, not an entity/stock purchase. Asset purchases let you acquire specific assets (code, domain, customers, IP) without inheriting unknown liabilities—lawsuits, tax issues, or debts the seller didn't disclose. Entity purchases make sense for larger deals with specific contracts or licenses that can't transfer, but at sub-$100k, the simplicity and protection of asset purchase outweighs any tax advantages to sellers.

**Earnout structures** can bridge valuation gaps when buyer and seller disagree on price. A typical structure: 60-80% paid at closing, with 20-40% contingent on MRR maintenance over 6-12 months. This protects buyers against immediate post-sale churn while giving sellers upside for a smooth transition. Keep earnout periods short (under 12 months) and define calculation methods precisely in the agreement. Earnouts extending beyond one year become complex and often create friction.

**Post-acquisition transition best practices:**
- Build a complete credential handover document before closing
- Request 30-90 days of seller availability for questions
- Don't make major changes immediately—understand operations first
- Transfer knowledge gradually, not in a single overwhelming handoff
- Decide on customer communication strategy (some buyers prefer stealth transitions; others announce new ownership)

The first 90 days should focus on stability, not optimization. Resist the urge to "improve" things until you fully understand why they're built the way they are.

## Conclusion

The sub-$100k SaaS acquisition market is underserved by traditional brokers but increasingly well-served by purpose-built marketplaces. **Acquire.com is the clear starting point** for verified SaaS listings with reasonable fees—but don't overlook Microns.io for zero-fee deals and the indie hacker community for off-market opportunities.

At this deal size, expect to pay **2-4x annual profit** and do your own due diligence. The $1,500-$4,500 you'll spend on developer code review, accountant verification, and legal review is far cheaper than a broker's 10-15% fee—and builds skills you'll use on future acquisitions.

Focus your search on self-serve, low-touch products with diversified customer bases and documented operations. Verify everything through direct platform access, not screenshots. Use asset purchases to limit liability exposure. And most importantly: don't fall in love with any single deal. The biggest advantage small buyers have is the ability to walk away—there are always more businesses for sale tomorrow.
